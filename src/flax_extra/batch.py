r"""Batch types and data processing functions.

The batch, inputs, and targets in **Training API** usually
represented using unnormalized form for user convenience.

During construction of :class:`TrainLoop` data get normalized.

In that form, a batch is a tuple, `((x,...), (y,...))`, that consist of:

- inputs, `(x,...)`, a tuple of a single array or multiple arrays.
    Inputs get passed to model's `apply(x,...)` function as arguments.
- targets, `(y,...)`, a tuple of arbitrary size or an empty tuple.
    Targets along with model outputs, `(o,...)`, get passed to a
    `loss(o,...,y,...)` function as arguments.
